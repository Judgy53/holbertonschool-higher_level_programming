# python-if_else_loops_functions
Project in python to learn basic syntax, functions and how to control the flow of the code.

All projects were done during the bridge to full stack specialization, at Holberton School.

## 0-positive_or_negative.py - Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.

The output of the program should be:
- The number, followed by
    - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    - if the number is 0: `is zero`
    - if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
- followed by a new line

## 1-last_digit.py - The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.

The output of the program should be:
- The string `Last digit of`, followed by
    - the number, followed by
    - the string `is`, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
        - if the last digit is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
        - if the last digit is 0: the string `and is 0`
        - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
- followed by a new line

## 2-print_alphabet.py - I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This program will print the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

## 3-print_alphabt.py - When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
This program will print the ASCII alphabet except `q` and `e`, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

## 4-print_hexa.py - Hexadecimal printing 
This program will print all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal in the format `16 = 0x10`

## 5-print_comb2.py - 00...99
This program will print all numbers from 0 to 99.
- Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line

## 6-print_comb3.py - Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need 
This program will print all possible different combinations of two digits.
- Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
- The two digits must be different
- 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line

## 7-islower.py - islower 
Function that checks for lowercase character.
- Prototype: `def islower(c):`
- Returns `True` if `c` is lowercase
- Returns `False` otherwise

## 8-uppercase.py - To uppercase
Function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `def uppercase(str):`

## 9-print_last_digit.py - There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Function that prints the last digit of a number.
- Prototype: `def print_last_digit(number):`
- Returns the value of the last digit.

## 10-add.py - a + b
Function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- Prototype: `def add(a, b):`
- Returns the value of `a + b`

## 11-pow.py - a ^ b 
Function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value.
- Prototype: `def pow(a, b):`
- Returns the value of `a ^ b`

## 12-fizzbuzz.py - Fizz Buzz
Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
- For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for multiples of five print `Buzz`.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
- Prototype: `def fizzbuzz():`
- Each element should be followed by a space

## 100-print_tebahpla.py -  Smile in the mirror
This program will print the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase), not followed by a new line.

## 101-remove_char_at.py
Function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
- Prototype: `def remove_char_at(str, n):`
